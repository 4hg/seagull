# Seagull
Seagull is a simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life in Python using curses.

If you are unfamiliar, you can read about it [here](http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~lipa/mec/lesson6.html).

There is not much to this right now, but I hope to add more to it in the future. I was really only interested in a brief introduction to curses.

To run: simply clone, run `python3 cgol.py`, and use `ctrl+c` to terminate the program. The Windows version of python does not ship with curses as it was written for Unix systems, check out the [docs](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/curses.html) for more information on that, but of course, if you use WSL then running this should not be an issue.
